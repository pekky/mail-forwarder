# Engineering Playbook (Cross-Agent)

This repository contains team-wide conventions and agent templates that are **project-agnostic**.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo locally.
2. In each project, copy templates from `templates/`.
3. Agents should read project `README.md` + `AGENTS.md`, then reference conventions in `conventions/`.

## Contents
- `conventions/` Team-wide coding/architecture/product standards
- `agents/` Agent-specific entry instructions (Claude, Codex, Kimi, Gemini)
- `templates/` Project templates (README, AGENTS, PROJECT_GUIDE)
