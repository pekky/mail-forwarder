# Product Conventions

## Requirements
- Express requirements in user-facing language.
- Capture constraints and non-goals explicitly.

## Iteration
- Prefer small, shippable increments.
- Define acceptance criteria before implementation.

## Quality
- Define "done" for each milestone (tests, docs, checks).
- Track edge cases and failure modes.
